# Advent of Code 2023
***
Giving [Advent of Code][aoc] a try for the Mainframe Advent of Code. Lot of chatter on [Discord][discord] about the event.

- Day 1
  - **The problem:** Global snow production. We find ourselves being launched out of a trebuchet after solving a calibration document in an attempt to fix it.
  - **The code:** Writing a script to read arcane calibration notes and create some running tally.
- Day 2
  - **The problem:** We've landed on a large island in the sky: _Snow Island_. An elf wants to explain the lack of snow, but to explain the issue the elf must show something -- we take a walk. On the walk this bozo plays some obscure game where you pull cubes out of a bag. The problem is that there is no water on _Snow Island_ to make said snow. The elf shows us how to get to the water source.
  - **The code:** Much easier than Day 1, had to count blocks and determine if the games were possible or not and then determine the minimum viable blocks to make each game possible. More running tallies.
